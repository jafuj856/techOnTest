# Techon - Simple Dashboard

Welcome to the **Techon Dashboard**! This is a simple React-based dashboard created to showcase my ability to build responsive, functional, and interactive web applications. This dashboard was developed as part of a technical test for a position at **Techon**.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in building a modern web application using React.js. The dashboard includes basic functionality to interact with a UI, display content, and work with state management, all within the context of a simple but effective layout.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes interactive elements such as buttons, modals, and dropdowns to showcase my ability to handle user interactions.
- **Dynamic Content**: A basic example of displaying dynamic content using React state and props.
- **Material-UI Integration**: This project uses Material-UI components to build a modern UI design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated for additional styling flexibility and utility-first CSS approach.

## Tech Stack

-**React.js**: The core library for building the user interface.
-**Vite.js**: Modern build tool and development server for faster development experience.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building consistent, modern design systems.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling approach and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the components and layout.

## Getting Started

## Implementation Details

### Responsive Design
The dashboard is fully responsive and has been optimized for various screen sizes:
- Desktop (1024px and above)
- Tablet (768px to 1023px)
- Mobile (below 768px)

### Component Architecture
The application follows a modular component architecture, making it easy to maintain and scale:
- **Header Component**: Contains navigation and user profile
- **Sidebar Component**: Provides access to different sections
- **Dashboard Component**: Main view with analytics and statistics
- **Cards Component**: Reusable card components for displaying data
- **Charts Component**: Visual representation of data

### State Management
Simple state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) for this demonstration.

### Styling Approach
Used a combination of Material-UI components and Tailwind CSS utilities for styling:
- Material-UI for structured components
- Tailwind CSS for custom styling and responsive design

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized images
- Minimized re-renders using React.memo where appropriate

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive features
- Implement full authentication flow
- Expand dashboard with additional views
- Add dark/light theme toggle
- Implement more complex data visualization
