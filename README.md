# Techon - Simple Dashboard

Welcome to the **Techon Dashboard**! This is a simple React-based dashboard created to showcase my ability to build responsive, functional, and interactive web applications. This dashboard was developed as part of a technical test for a position at **Techon**.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in building a modern web application using React.js. The dashboard includes basic functionality to interact with a UI, display content, and work with state management, all within the context of a simple but effective layout.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes interactive elements such as buttons, modals, and dropdowns to showcase my ability to handle user interactions.
- **Dynamic Content**: A basic example of displaying dynamic content using React state and props.
- **Material-UI Integration**: This project uses Material-UI components to build a modern UI design.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building consistent, modern design systems.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the components and layout.
